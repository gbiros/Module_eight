How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  
  To ensure my projects are functional and secure, I will develop
  effective habits and practices. I will verify that all requirements
  are being met and test the project often. I will also used what
  I have learned about software development and testing, to approach 
  each project as to be as efficient as possible in the process.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  
  The best way to interpret the user needs is to have an effective
  interview process. The user will have needs and goals of their 
  desired code, project, or software, it is important to limit
  ambiguity in the beginning stages of software development to 
  efficiently develop the project. Once we have the requirements,
  we can then develop accordingly and have an action plan for
  the testing portion of the project.

How do I approach designing software?

  After gaining the knowledge of the user requirements we can
  begin the development process. It is important to understand
  the requirements of the project first to get an idea of the details
  about the project. There are serveral types of software development
  models we can follow, but knowing the difference and what would
  be best for the situation you are in will help with efficiency.
  I like to keep my approach very flexible as each project will
  be different, so having the same approach everytime may not be
  as efficient. This is why planning for the project is crucial to
  the software development life cycle.
